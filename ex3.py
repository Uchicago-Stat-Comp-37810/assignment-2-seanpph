# Exercise 3

print("I will now count my chickens:")

print("Hens", 25 + 30 / 6)
print("Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4)

print("Now I will count the eggs:")

print(3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6)

print("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?")

print(3 + 2 < 5 - 7)

print("What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2)
print("What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7)

print("Oh, that's why it's False.")

print("How about some more.")

print("Is it greater?", 5 > -2)
print("Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2)
print("Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2)

# Study Drills

## 1: Above each line, use the # to write a comment to yourself
##    explaining what the line does.

print("I will now count my chickens:")

print("Hens", 25 + 30 / 6) # compute 25 + (30/6)
print("Roosters", 100 - 25 * 3 % 4) # compute 100 - (25*3) % 4

print("Now I will count the eggs:")

print(3 + 2 + 1 - 5 + 4 % 2 - 1 / 4 + 6) # compute 3+2+1-5+(4%2)-(1/4)+6

print("Is it true that 3 + 2 < 5 - 7?")

print(3 + 2 < 5 - 7) # determine if (3+2) < (5-7)

print("What is 3 + 2?", 3 + 2) # compute 3+2
print("What is 5 - 7?", 5 - 7) # compute 5-7

print("Oh, that's why it's False.")

print("How about some more.")

print("Is it greater?", 5 > -2) # determine if 5>-2
print("Is it greater or equal?", 5 >= -2) # determine if 5>=-2
print("Is it less or equal?", 5 <= -2) # determine if 5<=-2

## 2: Remember in Exercise 0 when you started python3.6? Start python3.6
##    this way again and, using the math operators, use Python as a calculator.

print("What is 2 * 5?", 2 * 5)

## 3: ind something you need to calculate and write a new .py file that does it.

print("What is 2 * 6?", 2 * 6)


## 4. Rewrite ex3.py to use floating point numbers so it's more
##    accurate. 20.0 is floating point.

print("Is 2.0 * 5 a float?", isinstance(2.0*5,float))
print("What is 2.0 * 5?", 2.0 * 5)
