# Exericse 2

# A comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python.

print("I could have code like this.") # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out code:
# print("This won't run.")

print("This will run.")

# Study drill

## 1: Find out if you were right about what the # character does and
##    make sure you know what it's called (octothorpe or pound character).

# print("Hello World")

# I am right about this character. The code behinds pount character
# will not run.

## 2: Take your ex2.py file and review each line going backward. Start at
##    the last line, and check each word in reverse against what you should
##    have typed.

# Again, we can see that any code behinds "#" will not run.
# But codes in front of "#" will run.

## 3: Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.

# Since codes in front of "#" will run, we must have a valid code if it is
# in front of "#".

## 4: Read what you typed above out loud, including saying each character
##    by its name. Did you find more mistakes? Fix them.

# That is all.
